"""
DraftIQ Engine
==============
Consolidated, de-duplicated version of the DraftIQ draft assistant.

Source consolidation notes (kept for reference):
- calculate_position_urgency: 6 identical copies collapsed to 1 (was v0.3.10)
- calculate_draft_urgency: kept v0.3.9 (most developed), dropped earlier plain version
- get_draft_recommendations: kept v0.3.8 (most developed), dropped plain + v0.3.7
- what_if_i_wait: kept the non-simulation version. The "simulation-based" version
  called simulated_next_pick_probability(), which was never defined anywhere in the
  source material, so it would crash. If you want real simulation-backed wait
  probabilities, build_simulation_scores()/simulate_draft_path_fast() below can be
  wired up to power that later.
- Fixed: availability_score() referenced an undefined `drafted_players` global — this
  function was unused elsewhere (superseded by next_pick_probability) and dropped.
- Fixed: tier_table used to be computed once at import time and never refreshed, so
  tiers silently went stale as the draft progressed. It's now recomputed on demand.
- Fixed: get_roster_needs() only ever returns "HIGH"/"OK", never "MEDIUM" — the
  "MEDIUM" branches in calculate_draftiq_score/compare_players were dead code and
  are left out.
- Fixed: player-team indexing. MY_TEAM/settings["user_slot"] are 1-indexed team
  numbers; draft_state now stores a consistent 0-indexed "user_team_index".
- All state (league, draft_state, players_df) now lives on a DraftIQEngine instance
  instead of module-level globals, so it behaves correctly under a web server.
- All display()/print()-based output has been converted to return values (dicts /
  list-of-dicts) so the Flask layer can render them.

        Groups each position into tiers based on gaps in overall rank.

        The gap threshold that defines "a new tier starts here" is
        calibrated to each position's own typical rank spacing rather than
        a fixed constant. A flat threshold (e.g. "gap >= 5") only works if
        `rank` is itself position-specific (RB1, RB2, RB3...). Real rank
        sheets use an OVERALL rank, where other
        positions' players are naturally interleaved between same-position
        neighbors. That inflates the typical gap between, say, RB5 and RB6
        to well beyond 5 even when they're genuinely similar quality, which
        used to fracture a position into dozens of 1-2-player "tiers" and
        spam alerts. Scaling the threshold to each position's own median
        gap keeps tiers meaningful regardless of which rank convention the
        input data uses.

        A single global gap threshold still isn't enough on real data,
        though: the top of a position is usually tightly and consistently
        ranked (small, regular gaps), while the deep/replacement-level end
        is noisier (rankers have much less conviction distinguishing RB40
        from RB45, so raw gaps there are larger and more erratic even
        though there's no real talent cliff). That noise was still
        splitting the deep end of each position into a lot of spurious
        1-2-player tiers - which, among other things, made those isolated
        players falsely look like they were facing a scarcity "cliff" and
        get an unwarranted urgency boost. After gap-based tiering, any tier
        smaller than MIN_TIER_SIZE gets merged into its neighbor so a
        "tier" only exists when there are enough players in it to be a
